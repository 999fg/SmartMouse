# SmartMouse

## About this Project
Mouse is one of the most successful, important, and efficient input device for most of the computer users today. Also, development of mobile computing technology enables more and more users to use their laptop anytime, anywhere. Although there are embedded touch pads in laptop, due to their difficult usage, many users carry regular mice whenever they carry the laptop. However, carrying mouse all the time is very cumbersome and inconvenient, and there is a high chance of loss.
Our idea is to use smartphones and smartwatches, which we bring all the time, as mouse. This greatly reduce the effort to carry additional device any more, and can be applied in various situations such as doing presentation. Especially, our specific goal is to implement the smart mouse that does not depend on any other outer devices while obtaining high accuracy.
